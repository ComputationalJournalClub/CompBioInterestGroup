# Computational Biology Interest Group, UPenn

# January 2016

# Description

We are a group of analytically oriented junior faculty, postdocs, and students, with a general interest in computational biology. We strongly agree with Doug Green: "Creativity emerges from a combinatorial process in which bits of information are rearranged and extrapolated at a subconscious levelâ€”think of it as a conceptual smoothie sloshing around in your brain." and the only way to help this process is to read. 

# Objectives

The central goal of our interest group is to read genomics and proteomics articles and focus on their methodologies. We will dig deep into supplementary methods and may not even get to Figure 5. We will meet on Mondays 9-10am in 301 BRB.
